<br>
<p>Hello, I'm David and this is my journey as a Software Engineer</p>
<p>I didn't start out as a software developer, in fact, my journey began with a degree in Networks and Telecommunications. That's where I first got into Linux systems, networking, and protocolos. While I was still studying for my bachelor's degree, I started working as a freelancer. Over the past 12 years, I've worked across frontend and backend development, as well infrastructure. I've held roles like Developer, Architect, DevOps, MLOps, and Platform Engineer.</p>
<p>I'm interested in distributed systems (mostly with Go), Compilers, MLOps, LLMs, and AI agents. I enjoy digging into new technologies and figuring things out as I go, whether it's through side or open source projects, or just experimenting.</p>
<p>This blog is where I share what I'm learning and whatever else I find interesting along the way. I'll either try... or panic, usually both ðŸ¤£</p>
<br>
<p>Outside of tech, I spend my free time climbing, mountaineering, and capturing moments through photography.</p>
