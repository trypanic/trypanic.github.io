<p>Hi there! I'm David.</p>
<p>Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked from frontend and backend development to infrastructure. I've held roles like Developer, Architect, DevOps, MLOps, and platform engineering. I have a kwnoledge in networking, with an undergrad in the field, so Iâ€™m very familiar with Linux systems, networking and protocols.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m interested in distributed systems (mostly with Go), Compilers, MLOps, LLMs, and AI agents. I enjoy digging into new technologies and figuring things out as I go, whether it's through side or open source projects, or just experimenting.</p>
<p>This blog is where I share what Iâ€™m learning and whatever else I find interesting along the way. Iâ€™ll either try... or panic â€” usually both ðŸ¤£</p>
<br>
<p>Outside of tech, I spend my free time climbing, mountaineering, and capturing moments through photography.</p>
