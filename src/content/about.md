# About me

<br />

Hello, I'm David and this is my journey as a Software Engineer

I didn't start out as a software developer, in fact, my journey began with a degree in Networks and Telecommunications. That's where I first got into Linux systems, networking, and protocolos. While I was still studying for my bachelor's degree, I started working as a freelancer. Over the past 12 years, I've worked across frontend and backend development, as well infrastructure. I've held roles like Developer, Architect, DevOps, MLOps, and Platform Engineer.

I'm interested in distributed systems (mostly with Go), Compilers, MLOps, LLMs, and AI agents. I enjoy digging into new technologies and figuring things out as I go, whether it's through side or open source projects, or just experimenting.

This blog is where I share what I'm learning and whatever else I find interesting along the way. I'll either try... or panic, usually both ðŸ¤£

<br />

Outside of tech, I spend my free time climbing, mountaineering, and capturing moments through photography.
