Although years ago I occasionally wrote on Medium under a different nickname -[@davidenq](https://linkedin/in/davidenq) (now used only on my LinkedIn profile), I recently decided to start writing again, this time under a new name (trypanic). I also considered whether to continue on [Medium](https://medium.com/@trypanic), but in the end, I decided to create a new, more personalized space. Why? Just for fun!


Well, this marks a new adventure, a chance to reinvent myself and create a space to share my thoughts, experiments, research, and anything else I find interesting along the way. I just hope I can be more consistent this time and not forget about it!

## Are you curious?

### Curious about my old posts?

You can check out those in Spanish [here](https://medium.com/@trypanic). Someday, I'll probably rewrite them in English and post them here.

### Curious about the name trypanic?

Well, trypanic is a combination of two keywords often found in Python programming: `try` and `panic`. It represents the process of trying (to reinvent the wheel, create new things, and explore) and then panicking when something doesn't work well, or simply breaks.

Honestly, it wasn’t my first choice. I came up with many other names, but they were either already taken, hard to remember, or just sounded weird.

In fact, I didn’t even think too hard about the meaning of trypanic until I started writing this post. Before that, I just thought it sounded kinda cute and friendly.

## Final words!

Stay tuned for posts about software engineering, computer science, artificial intelligence, and more. I just hope I can be more consistent this time and not forget about it!
